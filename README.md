# PHP-Cart
A fully functional PHP shopping cart
<p>You can add or remove items from the cart and pay with card or paypal.</p>
<p>For testing I included the code for the mysql database and for payments I used <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/hu?locale=hu">Braintree</a>.</p>
<p>Run <code>composer install </code> in terminal.</p>
<p>You can download composer from <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">here</a>.</p>
